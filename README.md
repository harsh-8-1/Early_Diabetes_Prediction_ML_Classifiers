# Early_Diabetes_Prediction_ML_Classifiers

-> I have used machine learning classifiers to compare and analyze accuracy of different machine learning classifier models.

-> The proposed method uses Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.

-> The result shows that the Random Forest achieved highest accuracy of 81.506.
